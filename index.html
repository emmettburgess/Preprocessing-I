      <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
        <p class="main-content-p">
          I'll be 25 years old on April 1st. I live in Utah with my wife, parents, and brother. I have one stupid dog, a cat with severe arthritis, and another cat with autism. I own more than 4000 books, and I've read every single one of them at least once. In my free time I work on my fantasy novel series, of which I'm on the 2nd book currently, and a short story I wrote is getting published in a fiction magazine in April. I like pasta, Mt Dew, and Vanilla Coke.</p>
          
          <p class="main-content-p">I also enjoy studying languages and creating fictional languages for my books. I'm only fluent in English, but I can get by in Spanish, French, Italian, and German. I also have a passing adequacy in reading Egyptian hieroglyphs. I'm learning web development at Lambda School because being a novelist isn't paying the bills at the moment and I can't afford to go to any other school.</p>

      <h2>Here's some other stuff, idk...</h2>
      <p>In 2004 I incubated chicken eggs for a school project and one of them died before he hatched. I have him preserved in a jar, and his name is Alex.</p>
      <p>I've lived in Washington, Montana, Oregon, California, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. No, my dad wasn't in the military. He just liked changing careers.</p>
      <p>I got my Eagle Scout when I was 14. For my project I built an amphitheater at Martin's Cove, Wyoming. You can go visit it if you want.</p>
      <p>In 2014 I decided to be a backpacking hippie and travel the world. I ended up being held against my will in this dude's camper in the middle of the Mojave Desert for three months and eventually fought my way out. My family had no idea where I was at the time.</p>
      <p>I know all of the words to "It's the End of the World as We Know It" by REM.</p>
      <p>The first person on my dad's side to come to America was a Hessian mercenary named Johann Borges, my great-great-great-great-grandfather. He was hired to help Britain put an end to the Revolutionary War. Meanwhile, Alexander Hamilton, my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather on my mother's side, was leading the colonists in war against Britain. Johann Borges ended up being Hamilton's prisoner after the Hessians lost a battle, and then Hamilton set him free. Weird how these two men were on opposite sides of the same conflict and met each other, and they had no idea that their descendants would marry.</p>
